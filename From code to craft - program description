## From code to craft: Thinking in code, making it real


Scratch, Minecraft, littleBits and Arduino - in this session we'll begin with an 
exploration of the Scratch programming language as a foundation for coding and creating. 
Building on this, during the second day, we will learn how to interact with real and 
virtual worlds using Minecraft, littleBits and Arduino in combination with Scratch. We 
will be providing access to online resources and learning materials 
in advance of the 3 day session.

Prior programming experience is not needed.
